## Distribution Blueprint — SDR‑Only MVP (Beginner‑Friendly)

This guide explains, step by step, how to get users and paying customers for an SDR‑only MVP. It assumes zero prior experience with marketing or distribution.

### What you’re selling (in simple terms)
- A fast website to look up Texas water wells from the SDR data. Users can:
  - Search by address or point on a map, filter by date/depth/county, and see nearby wells
  - Download a clean PDF/CSV report for clients or internal use
  - Optionally process small batches (e.g., up to 50 addresses) and get a ZIP of reports

### Who is most likely to buy (start here)
- Environmental due‑diligence and consulting firms
- Hydrogeology/civil engineering firms
- Water well drillers (small to mid‑size)
- Real estate: appraisers, inspectors, title/escrow teams
- Utilities/public works/county planning staff
- Agriculture/land developers; insurers/underwriters

Why they care: They often spend 20–60 minutes per site on slow portals and manual exports. A fast, standardized report saves time and reduces mistakes.

## Objectives and simple success metrics

Think of these as “checkpoints” to know it’s working.

- Get 3–5 paid pilot customers within 30–60 days
- Time to first report for a new user ≤ 5 minutes
- At least 10 users generating reports every week
- Pilot conversion rate ≥ 25% (1 out of 4 interested teams becomes a paying pilot)

Key numbers to watch (don’t overthink):
- CTR (ad click‑through rate): aim ≥ 2.5%
- LP CVR (landing page conversion): aim ≥ 5% request demo or sign up
- CAC (customer acquisition cost): aim ≤ first month revenue from a customer

---

## Step 1 — Set up your foundation (1–3 days)

1) Landing page
- Clearly state the problem and outcome
  - Problem: “Finding SDR well info is slow and messy.”
  - Outcome: “Search, map, and export client‑ready reports in minutes.”
- Show a sample PDF and CSV (one click to view). Add screenshots.
- Add a short demo video (≤ 3 minutes). Show search → map → export.
- Place a single call‑to‑action: “Start a pilot” or “Book a 15‑minute demo”.
- Include SDR attribution/disclaimer (see “Compliance”, below).

2) Analytics (to see what works)
- Install GA4 or PostHog on the landing page.
- Track: page views, button clicks (demo/pilot), and sign‑ups. That’s enough to start.

3) CRM + email
- Use a simple CRM (e.g., HubSpot free) to store leads and track follow‑ups.
- Create one email list for newsletters/announcements in an email tool (e.g., Mailchimp).

4) Support and contact
- Add a support email (e.g., support@yourdomain) and a short form. Respond within 1–2 business days.

---

## Step 2 — Create convincing proof (1–2 days)

1) Sample outputs
- PDF report: clean header, map, table of results, “as‑of” date, SDR attribution, and disclaimer.
- CSV export: clear column names; include `sdr_id`, owner_name, county, lat/lon, depth_ft, date_completed.

2) Short demo video (≤ 3 minutes)
- Show: type an address → results appear → click export. No fluff.

3) One‑pager (PDF)
- Audience: consultants/drillers. Sections: problem, solution, sample, pricing starting points, contact.

---

## Step 3 — Offers and pricing (test, don’t guess)

Start simple. You can change pricing later.

- Solo plan: $49–$99/month; includes X reports/mo; CSV export; extra reports $1–$3 each
- Team plan: $199–$399/month; higher limits; batch up to 50 addresses; priority support
- One‑off consumer report: $19–$29 (quick property check)
- Pilot offer: 60 days, discounted team plan; success if they generate N reports/week and want to renew

Tip: Put pricing on the site. It increases trust and filters tire‑kickers.

---

## Step 4 — How to reach buyers (channels that work)

1) Partnerships (high leverage)
- Texas and US groundwater associations (examples: Texas Ground Water Association, Texas Alliance of Groundwater Districts, National Ground Water Association)
- Ask for: newsletter mention, member webinar, small sponsorship, and a member discount code

2) Direct outreach (very effective for first pilots)
- Build a short list (10–30 orgs/segment): due‑diligence firms, hydro/civil, drillers, title/escrow
- Send 3 short emails over 7–10 days (templates below)
- Goal: book a 15‑minute demo and propose a pilot

3) Webinars (show, don’t tell)
- Host a 30‑minute “How to get a well report in 10 minutes” session
- Offer a live Q&A and a pilot discount for attendees

4) Paid ads (small, focused tests)
- Search ads: “Texas well report”, “nearby wells SDR”, “water well depth Texas”
- LinkedIn ads: job titles (Environmental Consultant, Hydrogeologist, Drilling Ops, Title Officer)
- Budget small ($2–5k for first month). Kill underperformers quickly; keep only what converts.

5) Marketplaces/directories (credibility)
- Capterra/GetApp listings (Environmental, GIS, Due Diligence categories)
- If you expose an API, list on developer hubs (e.g., Postman) later.

## Step 5 — Exact things to say (copy you can paste)

1) Cold email (consultants)
- Email 1 (short):
  - Subject: Quick SDR well reports
  - Body: “We built a faster way to find nearby wells from SDR and export a client‑ready PDF/CSV in minutes. Can I send a 2‑minute demo video?”
- Email 2 (value):
  - “Typical users save 20–60 minutes per site vs. manual portals. Here’s a sample report [link]. Interested in a 15‑minute pilot demo?”
- Email 3 (ask):
  - “We’re offering a 60‑day discounted pilot to a few teams. Worth a quick look?”

2) LinkedIn message (after connect)
- “We help teams generate SDR well reports in minutes (search → map → export). Happy to share a quick demo if useful.”

3) Landing page hero
- Headline: “Texas well lookups in minutes”
- Subhead: “Search SDR wells by address or point, filter by depth/date, and export client‑ready PDF/CSV instantly.”
- Button: “Start a pilot” or “Book a 15‑minute demo”

4) Webinar outline (30 minutes)
- 5 min: Problem (slow portals) and who it helps
- 10 min: Live demo (search → map → export)
- 10 min: Q&A
- 5 min: Pilot offer and next steps

---

## Step 6 — Compliance and attribution (must include)

Place this on the site footer, About page, and report footers:
- “Contains data from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Statewide Driller’s Report (SDR). TWDB provides this data as‑is, without warranty, and does not endorse this product.”
- “Information is provided ‘as is’ and may contain errors or omissions. Not a substitute for official records or site surveys. Verify with the original source and qualified professionals.”
- Show an “as‑of” date: “SDR snapshot: YYYY‑MM‑DD; updated nightly when available.”
- Keep owner names visible only where needed; require login for bulk exports.

---

## Step 7 — 30‑day rollout calendar (simple plan)

Week 1
- Finish landing page, sample PDF/CSV, demo video
- Set up analytics (GA4/PostHog), CRM (HubSpot), and email list
- Start outreach to associations for a member webinar slot

Week 2
- Send first cold emails (20–40 total); post on LinkedIn; book demos
- Publish two short posts: “How to find nearby wells quickly” and “What’s in an SDR report”
- Launch small search ad test (≤ $50/day);

Week 3
- Host a 30‑minute webinar; offer a pilot discount for attendees
- Start 2–3 pilots; implement a referral link in exported PDFs
- Pause weak ads; keep winners

Week 4
- Gather testimonials from early pilots
- Adjust pricing or packaging based on usage
- Aim for 3–5 paid pilots and ≥ 10 weekly active report creators

---

## Step 8 — What to measure (and what “good” looks like)

Daily/weekly
- Visitors → demo requests → pilots started (funnel)
- Reports generated per user
- Ad metrics: CTR ≥ 2.5%, landing CVR ≥ 5%

Monthly
- Paid pilots → paid plans (renewal intent)
- CAC ≤ first month revenue; time‑to‑pilot ≤ 14 days
- Churn ≤ 5%/month

If numbers are below target, try:
- Tighten messaging (specific problems); add more proof (samples/testimonials)
- Focus on the channel with the most demo requests
- Increase partnerships (webinars and newsletters)

---

## FAQ (quick answers you’ll give prospects)

1) Where does data come from?
- Texas Water Development Board SDR. We refresh nightly when available and show an “as‑of” date.

2) How accurate is it?
- Data is provided as‑is. We standardize fields and show location confidence; verify with official records for legal decisions.

3) Can I export data?
- Yes, PDF/CSV from the site. Batch up to 50 addresses on team plans. API access is available on request.

4) Do you have aquifer or oil/gas overlays?
- MVP is SDR‑only. We plan to add enrichment next based on demand.

## Glossary (plain English)
- CTR: % of people who click your ad. Higher is better.
- CVR: % of people who complete an action (e.g., request a demo). Higher is better.
- CAC: how much you spent to get a customer. Lower than first month revenue is a good start.
- Pilot: a discounted trial with clear success criteria and a set duration (e.g., 60 days).
- ICP: ideal customer profile (who it’s built for).

## Final checklist before you launch
- [ ] Landing page with a clear promise, sample outputs, demo video, and one CTA
- [ ] SDR attribution and disclaimers shown on site and reports
- [ ] Analytics + CRM + email list are live
- [ ] Outreach list created; first emails ready to send
- [ ] Webinar date scheduled; deck and demo script ready
- [ ] Small search ad test configured with 3–5 keyword groups and ad variants

If you follow this blueprint step by step, you’ll get real users, real feedback, and (most importantly) the first paying customers without wasting months on broad marketing. Expand only the channels that prove they work.
